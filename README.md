This is a game i built together with my friend Admir NumanoviÄ‡ [admir.numanovic@edu.fit.ba] for the annual FIT CC competition that is held on the Faculty of Information Technologies in Mostar,BiH  

ðŸ¥‰The game won 3rd place.  

Game story : The game is set in the 1800's, the time when the samurai culture started to fade and lose its worth. That is why many problems occured. In a small village, a few kilometers away from Tokio, Hideyo, the main character, was living with his grandpa. His parents and many others in that village were killed by the evil ruler, Satoshi, whose warriors came to the village often to collect loot from the poor villagers. Everyone who stood in their way was removed. One day, when Hideyo was not at home, his grandpa was taken. His grandpa was the leader of the villagers and was helping everyone. Satoshi thought that by removing him, the villagers would give up and continue to be literral slaves to him. But he didn't count on Hideyo. The game starts here. Hideyo tries to save his grandpa before he is killed. The game is full of interesting elements including interactions with the villagers, looting of houses, fighting against enemies and more. The game end is very surprising and different than other game endings.  

Everyone is free to download and play our game, and we are open to feedback.
